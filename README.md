JTomato
=======

Rotten Tomatoes API Java Client 

-Put your API key in /res/tomatoes.properties

-Tests are grouped in two categories: (1) tests that use the network and actully use the API, and (2) local tests that rely on a mock-up of the API.

-If you use this code in an Android app remember to put the INTERNET permission in your manifest and to use the client asynchrounouly w.r.t. to the UI thread (e.g., asynchtask)

-This is a beta-version, please report to me any bug: tambug@gmail.com
